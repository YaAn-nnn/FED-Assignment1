# Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Guide

## Description
This project is a website which helps users to understand the game, **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang** and its heroes. 
Throughout this website, users can recognise which herores are strong in the current patch and learn about the heroes' skills and talent.

## Purpose and Audience
This website is primarily catered to gaming enthusiasts, particularly players of the game **Mobile Legends**. The primary goal is to provide users with an interactive way to learn more about the heroes.

### Target Audience:
- Mobile Legends players who want to learn more about heroes they have never played.
- Mobile Legends players who are interested in a more competitive gameplay and want to know which heroes are strong in the current patch.
- People who wants to start playing the game but don't know which hero to start playing from.

### Purpose:
- To create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to attract players to view it.
- To allow players to learn more about a hero they are interested in.
- To allow players to learn about the heroes that are strong in the current patch.
- To attract current or new players to try and continue the game.

## Features:
- Index page has a hover effect, where users can hover over a hero to focus and enlarge it in width to show more of the hero design while the name of the hero will appear.
- Hero Ranking page also has a hover effect for hero icons with a slight enlarge effect.
- Hero Ranking and Hero Skills page has a back button for users to access the previous page conveniently.
- Hero Ranking and Hero Skills page are made responsive for mobile view to allow users to scroll down the tier list and skills.
- Index page is also made responsive according to user's page length and width.
- There are headers for all pages for desktop view to allow users to navigate to other pages.
- Headers are hidden in a sidebar for mobile view. The sidebar can be shown by clicking on the hamburger icon on top right. When clicked, sidebar will appear and rest of the page will be dimmer for better focus on sidebar.
- Back button, hamburger icon and sidebar menu change background colour to show users that it is clickable.


## Design Rationale

### User Experience (UX)
- **Ease of Navigation:** I used consistent layout patterns and intuitive design elements, such as a sidebar menu, to make navigation simple and straightforward.
- **Responsive Design:** The website adjusts to different screen sizes by using flexible layouts, percentages, and viewport-based units.
- **Interactive Features:** I included hover effects and scrolling animations to ensure that users stay engaged.
- **Dark Theme for Comfort:** I chose a dark theme because many gamers use this website in low-light environments or during late-night sessions. The darker color palette reduces eye strain, creating a more comfortable browsing experience.

### Aesthetic Choices
- **Color Scheme:** The dark background contrasts with vibrant colors (e.g., tier labels, interactive hover effects), making key elements stand out while maintaining a sleek and immersive look.
- **Typography:** Clean, legible fonts like "Mulish" ensure readability, while decorative fonts like "Jim Nightshade" add personality to titles.
- **Minimized Clutter:** The layout emphasizes a clean and spacious design, ensuring users can focus on key content without distractions.
